# Counter App

This is a simple React application that demonstrates a counter functionality. The counter has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 20. Users can increment or decrement the counter using buttons, and alerts are shown when the counter reaches its limits.

## Features

- Increment the counter value (up to a maximum of 20).
- Decrement the counter value (down to a minimum of 0).
- Alerts to notify users when the counter exceeds its limits.
